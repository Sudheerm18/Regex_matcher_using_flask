# Regex_matcher_using_flask

This is a simple web application built using Flask that replicates the core functionality of regex101.com. The app allows users to input a test string and a regular expression (regex) to display all matching patterns. Additionally, there's an email validation feature where users can check if an email address is valid using regex.

Features
Regex Matching: Users can input a test string and a regex pattern, and the app will display all the matches found.
Email Validation: A separate page allows users to validate email addresses using regex.
Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid regex pattern, the app handles the error gracefully and informs the user.
Responsive Design: The app is centered with a clean, user-friendly interface that is styled using basic CSS.
